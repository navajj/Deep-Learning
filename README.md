Here you will find the Python excercises for Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Neural Networks and more.
This repository is a complement to the AI Learning Trainings in www.JoseNava.info The idea is for you to learn from scratch, until you 
can implement complex algorithms.
