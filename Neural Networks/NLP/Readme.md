## Welcome to Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
In this course we will work with building models and preprocessing Text to obtain an input into a Neural Network. We will work with text and how you can build classifier is based on text models. We'll start by looking at sentiment in text, and learn how to build models that understand text that are trained on labeled text, and then can then classify new text based on what they've seen.
