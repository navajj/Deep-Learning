# Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Here you will find the Python excercises for Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Neural Networks and more.
This repository is a complement to the AI Learning Trainings in www.JoseNava.info The idea is for you to learn from scratch, until you 
can implement complex algorithms.

Some of the exercises, are work from the great community contributors Laurence Moroney and Andrew Ng. You can find them in: https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-moroney/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/
